# NshchayAgrawal-Hadoop-YARN-Project-End-to-end-PoC-Integration-of-sqoop-map-reduce-and-hive-hdfs-
In this project, we have transaction data which is daily recorded/stored in the RDBMS Now this data is transferred everyday into HDFS for further Big Data Analytics You will work on live Hadoop YARN cluster YARN is part of the Hadoop 2 0 ecosystem that lets Hadoop to decouple from MapReduce and deploy more competitive processing and wider array of applications You will work on the YARN central resource manager
In this project, we import the data  from relational database i.e MySQL and loaded into HDFS using sqoop, after importing the data we use map reduce program to process the data comming from sqoop and produces some meaningful data using batch processing. After we use hive query for producing the final result.
